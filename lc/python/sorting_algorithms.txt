While there are a large number of sorting algorithms, in practical implementations a few algorithms predominate. Insertion sort is widely used for small data sets, while for large data sets an asymptotically efficient sort is used, primarily heap sort, merge sort, or quicksort. Efficient implementations generally use a hybrid algorithm, combining an asymptotically efficient algorithm for the overall sort with insertion sort for small lists at the bottom of a recursion. Highly tuned implementations use more sophisticated variants, such as Timsort (merge sort, insertion sort, and additional logic), used in Android, Java, and Python, and introsort (quicksort and heap sort), used (in variant forms) in some C++ sort implementations and in .NET.

For more restricted data, such as numbers in a fixed interval, distribution sorts such as counting sort or radix sort are widely used. Bubble sort and variants are rarely used in practice, but are commonly found in teaching and theoretical discussions.

When physically sorting objects, such as alphabetizing papers (such as tests or books), people intuitively generally use insertion sorts for small sets. For larger sets, people often first bucket, such as by initial letter, and multiple bucketing allows practical sorting of very large sets. Often space is relatively cheap, such as by spreading objects out on the floor or over a large area, but operations are expensive, particularly moving an object a large distance â€“ locality of reference is important. Merge sorts are also practical for physical objects, particularly as two hands can be used, one for each list to merge, while other algorithms, such as heap sort or quick sort, are poorly suited for human use. Other algorithms, such as library sort, a variant of insertion sort that leaves spaces, are also practical for physical use.

Insertion sort

it's an in-place compare sort.

Best O(n), averge O(n^2), worst O(n^2) memory O(1) 

Pseudocode of the complete algorithm follows, where the arrays are zero-based:
    i = 1
    while i < length(A)
        j = i
        while j > 0 and A[j-1] > A[j]
            swap A[j] and A[j-1]
            j = j - 1
        end while
        i = i + 1
    end while

Selection sort:

Best O(n^2), average O(n^2), worst O(n^2), memory O(1)

its an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity,

Pseudocode of the implementation:

    /* a[0] to a[n-1] is the array to sort */
    int i,j;
    int n; // initialise to a's length
    
    /* advance the position through the entire array */
    /*   (could do j < n-1 because single element is also min element) */
    for (j = 0; j < n-1; j++)
    {
        /* find the min element in the unsorted a[j .. n-1] */
    
        /* assume the min is the first element */
        int iMin = j;
        /* test against elements after j to find the smallest */
        for (i = j+1; i < n; i++)
        {
            /* if this element is less, then it is the new minimum */
            if (a[i] < a[iMin])
            {
                /* found new minimum; remember its index */
                iMin = i;
            }
        }
    
        if (iMin != j) 
        {
            swap(a[j], a[iMin]);
        }
    }

Merge sort:

best O(nlogn) average O(nlogn) worst O(nlogn) memory O(n)

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:

Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
Top-down implementation
Example C-like code using indices for top-down merge sort algorithm that recursively splits the list (called runs in this example) into sublists until sublist size is 1, then merges those sublists to produce a sorted list. The copy back step is avoided with alternating the direction of the merge with each level of recursion.

    // Array A[] has the items to sort; array B[] is a work array.
    void TopDownMergeSort(A[], B[], n)
    {
        CopyArray(A, 0, n, B);           // duplicate array A[] into B[]
        TopDownSplitMerge(B, 0, n, A);   // sort data from B[] into A[]
    }
    
    // Sort the given run of array A[] using array B[] as a source.
    // iBegin is inclusive; iEnd is exclusive (A[iEnd] is not in the set).
    void TopDownSplitMerge(B[], iBegin, iEnd, A[])
    {
        if(iEnd - iBegin < 2)                       // if run size == 1
            return;                                 //   consider it sorted
        // split the run longer than 1 item into halves
        iMiddle = (iEnd + iBegin) / 2;              // iMiddle = mid point
        // recursively sort both runs from array A[] into B[]
        TopDownSplitMerge(A, iBegin,  iMiddle, B);  // sort the left  run
        TopDownSplitMerge(A, iMiddle,    iEnd, B);  // sort the right run
        // merge the resulting runs from array B[] into A[]
        TopDownMerge(B, iBegin, iMiddle, iEnd, A);
    }
    
    //  Left source half is A[ iBegin:iMiddle-1].
    // Right source half is A[iMiddle:iEnd-1   ].
    // Result is            B[ iBegin:iEnd-1   ].
    void TopDownMerge(A[], iBegin, iMiddle, iEnd, B[])
    {
        i = iBegin, j = iMiddle;
     
        // While there are elements in the left or right runs...
        for (k = iBegin; k < iEnd; k++) {
            // If left run head exists and is <= existing right run head.
            if (i < iMiddle && (j >= iEnd || A[i] <= A[j])) {
                B[k] = A[i];
                i = i + 1;
            } else {
                B[k] = A[j];
                j = j + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    void CopyArray(A[], iBegin, iEnd, B[])
    {
        for(k = iBegin; k < iEnd; k++)
            B[k] = A[k];
    }
    
    MergeSort(arr[], l,  r)
    If r > l
         1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:  
                 middle m = (l+r)/2
         2. Call mergeSort for first half:   
                 Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)
         3. Call mergeSort for second half:
                 Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
         4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
                 Call merge(arr, l, m, r)
